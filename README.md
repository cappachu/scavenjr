scavenjr
==========
scavenjr is a visual web parser, i.e. it attempts to parse listings on a web page without the use of CSS selectors or XPath selectors.

Motivation
----------
Web pages are created for humans to consume. Even badly designed webpages often have visual cues that assist with perceptive grouping. Loosely drawing from gestalt theory, **scavenjr** clusters the content of web pages and returns a relational data set that is easy to munge with clojure.

Examples
--------
