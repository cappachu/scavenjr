scavenjr
==========
scavenjr is an experimental visual web parser written in clojure. It attempts to parse listings on a web page without the use of CSS selectors or XPath selectors. Web pages are created for humans to consume. Even badly designed webpages often have visual cues that assist with perceptive grouping. Loosely drawing from gestalt theory, scavenjr clusters the content of web pages and returns a relational data set that is easy to munge with clojure.
